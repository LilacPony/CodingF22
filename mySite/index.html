				<p>Elise Howe is a first-year student in Lethbridge College's Multimedia Production course, pursuing graphic design and concept work on various media projects after spending her high-school years invested in digital media and attending the University of Lethbridge’s New Media diploma program in 2021. Born in 2003, Elise has lived in Lethbridge, Alberta for her entire life, and is eager to share her boundlessly creative drive with the world. With a passion for worldbuilding, character design, and roleplaying games, she hopes to embark on her own project in the future, be it a video game, web comic, or other creative endeavour.</p>

				<h4>Hobbies</h4>
				<p class="hobp text-justify">Elise spends most of her time drawing or playing games, exploring their vast digital worlds, and analyzing the strengths and flaws of a wide variety of genres, from gameplay to storytelling, to see what creates a memorable experience. She applies this knowledge to her own <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> games to keep her players entertained alongside building improv skills to keep on her toes even when things don’t go according to plan. These games also require extensive preparation for the possible outcomes players may throw at a dungeon master, alongside strong time-management skills to reinforce a campaign’s necessities and trim out less vital aspects of gameplay.</p>
			</div>
			<!--hob2-->
			<div class="col-sm-4 hob2">
				<h4>Work Experience</h4>
				<p class="hobp text-justify">In her spare time, she works at her family's candy store <i>How Sweet Inc</i>, preparing crafting materials, stocking shelves, and innovating workflow for the business through data management and website maintenance. Her hardworking attitude, flexible skillset, and plethora of day-brightening jokes keep the workplace lively and organized, even during slow days. With a newfound love for Downtown Lethbridge, she hopes that her family will leave a positive impact on the community through one sweet treat at a time.</p>
			</div>
			<!--hob3-->
			<div class="col-sm-4 hob13">
				<h4>Worldbuilding</h4>
				<p class="hobp text-justify">Alongside that, she dedicates hours to developing several worldbuilding projects, whether they’re game-related or wholly original stories and settings. These projects drive her to expand several skills from storytelling to illustration in order to expertly capture her vision and translate it to paper. Though her passion lies in character design and fantasy, she’s dabbled in sci-fi settings and landscape design, alongside different storytelling mediums such as role-playing game systems. Eager to expand her horizons, Elise hopes to continue learning new ways of sharing her stories with the world.</p>
