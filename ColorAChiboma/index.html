					<h4><b>No, really, what is it?</b></h4>
					<p>Chiboma is the Chimera Not-Mon, totally <b>not</b> a knockoff Pokémon for the fangame <a href="https://pokepigment.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Pokémon Pigment</a> (and soon-to-be Pokémon Verse)! It was once said to be a regular Not-Mon before a crystal fell from the sky and into its possession. This crystal, which soon became its token orb, granted it immense power and slowly transformed it into the legendary Not-Mon known for saving the Mythos Area-of-Residence from destruction many centuries ago… But now? Now it’s a cute little PNG for you to colour and make your own for free!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h4><b>How do I use this site?</b></h4>
					<p>Several options for customization have been laid out below, each neatly organized into its own category. Click on one of the colour circles to apply that colour and associated marking/design to the base on the right and keep going until you’re satisfied! Each option is based off one of its official designs, from regular-ol’ Chiboma to its ethereal forms, and even its shiny! Want to get rid of an option or clear your slate without refreshing the page? Click on the red X button to clear your selection; works best with add-ons like the gem or orb! You can even name your creation using the input form below the add-ons. Nifty, eh?</p>

					<h4 class="pb-1"><b>And now for something completely different</b></h4>
					<p>It’s been quite the semester, hasn’t it? Real-world issues aside, I’m more than incredibly grateful to be at the College and am ready to hopefully get my education back on track.</p>
					<p>I left the University of Lethbridge with frustration over lackluster courses and mismanagement of the strike. The semester before I left, I took the introductory new media course that was required for my degree and loathed every second of the bare-bones HTML and CSS we were “taught.” Given less than a month’s time to learn how to make a responsive webpage by implementing code libraries we were taught nothing about, I fell back on the essentials I taught myself in high school to scrape by with a passing grade. All the while I watched several of my peers, who our professor hoped we would help fix what they weren’t understanding, some of which were entirely new to computers, fall behind. With the frustrations of having to self-teach myself the basics of coding twice in a row, I was incredibly nervous as to how parts of this semester would go. Would I know how to teach myself new concepts? Could I keep up with learning JavaScript? Was I even cut out for coding in the first place?</p>
					<p>I am so happy the answer was yes. Having someone with experience guide you through everything from the basics to the more advanced material and explaining how and why it worked made the semester a blast from start to finish. I think the website I’m most proud of has to be the hometown assignment based purely on the CSS and image editing I had to wrangle to put something eye-catching and appealing together. There are not very many copyright-friendly images of Lethbridge out there funnily enough, so I had to improvise quite a bit. Even with the simple code hiccups that caught me off guard, I’m proud of how I managed to keep a level head through most of them and found out the very obvious and simple solutions instead of balking out of fear of imperfection. My anxiety and tendency to procrastinate was more than benefited by me taking my time to complete the more complex websites in chunks (e.g., Starting with basic HTML layout one day, working on CSS the next) instead of leaving it to the last minute and realizing it took more work than I expected. Despite my looming concerns of not being fit for school after last semester destroyed any ounce of motivation or self-confidence I had, I’m incredibly happy with how the semester turned out. I don’t think I’d change anything if I’m being honest, maybe except for giving myself a pat on the back for the hard work that went into it. All in all, I’m happy to continue building on the skills I learned, be it coding or self-disciplinary, and bring them into the next semester.</p>
